# match-match or memory game
There are some cards on the game board.
And there are always two identical images. Start the game by flipping a card. Then try to find another card that has the same image as the first. If you can't find a pair, the flipped cards will be flipped back with the face down. Try to remember these images as it becomes easier to find pairs the longer you play. 
When you find a pair they are removed from the board and when you find all the pairs in this memory, you have completed the level.
